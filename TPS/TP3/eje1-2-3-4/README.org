fractal-mpi: parallelized renderer for the Julia set.

This program renders Julia sets of the function f(z) = z^2 + c, coloring
interior points by their proximity to the set and exterior points by their
divergence rate.

This program renders Julia sets of the function f(z) = z^2 + c, coloring
interior points by their proximity to the set and exterior points by their
divergence rate.

The program reads image and fractal parameters from an input file (see the
examples directory), and any of these can be overriden with a command-line
argument.
